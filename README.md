### This iOS app allows users to search for movies using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API and display the results in a table view. Users can input search queries in a text field, and the app fetches movie data from the OMDb API based on the user's input. The app then displays the search results in a table view, showing movie titles, release years, and posters. Additionally, users can tap on a movie to view more details about it on IMDb via Safari View Controller.
